## üîê Security Headers

The standard starter includes a set of security headers by default in [`app/headers.ts`](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/blob/main/starters/standard/src/app/headers.ts). These help protect against common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and data injection.

### Changing CSP (Content Security Policy) headers

Sometimes you need to allow additional resources or modify the Content Security Policy (CSP) to accommodate third-party scripts, styles, or other assets. The CSP headers control what resources can be loaded and executed by your application.

#### Adding trusted domains

The default CSP in the starter focuses on the most critical security aspects. For many applications, this provides a good balance between security and functionality. When you need to integrate third-party resources, you can extend it like this:

<Aside>
  Your CSP should reflect your application's needs. Some apps require more
  permissive policies to function properly, while security-critical applications
  might need stricter controls. The key is understanding the tradeoffs and
  making informed decisions. For more information, see the [MDN Content Security
  Policy documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).
</Aside>

```diff
// In app/headers.ts
headers.set(
  "Content-Security-Policy",
- `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' https://challenges.cloudflare.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-src https://challenges.cloudflare.com; object-src 'none';`,
+ `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' https://challenges.cloudflare.com https://trusted-scripts.example.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-src https://challenges.cloudflare.com; img-src 'self' https://images.example.com; object-src 'none';`,
);
```

#### Allowing images from multiple sources

When working with images in your RedwoodJS application, you may need to load images from different sources such as remote URLs or data URIs. The default CSP configuration doesn't include an `img-src` directive, which means images from external sources will be blocked.

To allow images from remote URLs and data URIs, add the `img-src` directive to your CSP:

```diff
// In app/headers.ts
headers.set(
  "Content-Security-Policy",
- `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' https://challenges.cloudflare.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-src https://challenges.cloudflare.com; object-src 'none';`,
+ `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' https://challenges.cloudflare.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-src https://challenges.cloudflare.com; img-src 'self' https://trusted-images.example.com data:; object-src 'none';`,
);
```

This configuration allows:

- `'self'` - Images from your own domain
- `https://trusted-images.example.com` - Images from specific trusted domains
- `data:` - Data URIs (base64 encoded images)

<Aside type="caution">
  Be cautious when using `data:` URIs as they can significantly increase the
  size of your HTML. Only allow specific remote domains that you trust, and
  consider using a more restrictive CSP in production environments.
</Aside>

#### Using `nonce` for inline scripts

Sometimes you need to include inline scripts in your application, but Content Security Policy (CSP) blocks them by default for security reasons. RedwoodSDK automatically generates a fresh, cryptographically secure nonce value for each request You can access this nonce in document or page components rendered by the [router](./routing), using `rw.nonce`.

<Aside type="caution">
  Only use the nonce attribute for trusted inline scripts that you have full
  control over. Adding nonces to third-party or user-generated scripts defeats
  the purpose of CSP protection and could expose your application to cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks.
</Aside>

```tsx
export const Document = ({ rw, children }) => (
  <html lang="en">
    <head><!-- ... --></head>
    <body>
      <div id="root">{children}</div>

      <!-- Set the nonce the inline script -->
      <script nonce={row.nonce}>/* ... */</script>
    </body>
  </html>
);

export default defineApp([
  // ...
  render(Document, [
    // ...
  ]),
]);
```

### Lifting device permission restrictions

Sometimes you need to allow your web application to access device features like the camera, microphone, or geolocation. These permissions are controlled by the `Permissions-Policy` header.

By default, the standard starter includes restrictive permissions settings for security reasons.

To enable device access, you'll need to modify the `Permissions-Policy` header in your [`app/headers.ts`](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/blob/main/starters/standard/src/) file:

```diff
// In app/headers.ts
headers.set(
  "Permissions-Policy",
-  "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()",
+  "geolocation=self, microphone=self, camera=self"
);
```

The `self` keyword allows the feature to be used only by your own domain.
